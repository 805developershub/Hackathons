# 805 Developers Hub

## Hackathon Bulletin Board

Come here to find links for upcoming hackathons locally or online. If you find a hackathon
your interested let the group know. Maybe you could put a killer team together or find a fellow member to join you.
Competing in hackathons is not only a great way to meet new developers and gain practical experience, but also
a great thing to show off to employers.
